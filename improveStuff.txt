1 - Could the armor set be abstracted from the player class and put into its own class?
This could make it more managable and decrease the code inside of the Player Class.

2 - Add skill tree to the menu
The skill tree lets the user use level up points to get skills.
Still have to rework the functionality and how it fits in.

3 - Implement backend save function
This will check if the user has a player and skip straight to the gameplay part of the game.

4 - Work on the games and make sure they play correctly.
It doesn't look good, or play well if the games don't work correctly.

5 - createRandomFamiliar.js - modify this so that it isn't one big function
